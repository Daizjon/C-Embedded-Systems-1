Hardware bill of materials (beyond NXP FRDM-KL25Z and breadboard): <br/>
•1x  8Ω 0.5W Speaker (Alligator clips or similar needed to connect to leads)<br/>
•3x  Push-button Switch<br/>
•1x 1uF Capacitor<br/>
•1x 330Ω Resistor (Optional)<br/><br/>
Task 1: Work through the steps of the Lab 2 Tutorial.<br/>
Task 2: Modify the LCD driver code given to you in the Lab 2 Tutorial to use PORT D bits 0-3 
for the data bus (DB4-7) and PORT C bits 12, 13, and 16 for control lines E, R/~W, and RS 
respectively. (Be aware that making this change will cause the blue LED built into the 
microcontroller to flash. This is due to one of the PORT D bits directly driving the LED.)<br/>
Task 3: Use your three switches to drive a speaker according to the specifications listed on the 
next page.
