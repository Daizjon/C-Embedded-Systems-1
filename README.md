# KL25Z Embedded Systems

Embedded systems projects developed in C and ARM assembly using the NXP FRDM-KL25Z (ARM Cortex-M0+) development board and Keil MDK.

These projects focus on low-level hardware interaction, interrupt-driven programming, and microcontroller system configuration.



## Board Platform
- NXP FRDM-KL25Z
- ARM Cortex-M0+
- Keil uVision / ARM MDK
- Bare-metal programming (no RTOS)



## Projects Included

### KL25Z-Assembly-Intro
- ARM assembly implementation
- Integer square root using bisection method
- Introduction to Keil toolchain and memory model

### KL25Z-Interrupt-Driven-IO
- GPIO configuration
- Interrupt handling (IRQ)
- Debounced button inputs
- RGB LED control
- Timing measurements using software delay loops
- Stack usage and low-level register interaction

### KL25Z-Reference-Manuals
- KL25Z datasheets
- ARM Cortex-M reference documentation
- Board pinout references



## Concepts Demonstrated
- Direct register manipulation
- Interrupt service routines (ISR)
- GPIO configuration
- Stack behavior in embedded systems
- ARM startup files and system initialization
- Modular C structure (Device / Include / Sources separation)



These projects were developed to strengthen understanding of embedded firmware architecture and hardware-level debugging.
